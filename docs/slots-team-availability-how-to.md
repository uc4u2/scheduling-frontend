# Team Availability (Slots) How-To

This tab manages bookable slots per employee. It is different from shift assignment.

## Where to click

Manager Portal → Shifts & Availability → Team Availability (Enterprise views)

## What this tab is for

- Define **bookable slots** for each employee or recruiter.
- Control when clients can book each person.
- Independent from shift assignments (shifts track labor; slots control client booking windows).

## Step 1: Select a team member

1. Open Team Availability.
2. Choose the employee/recruiter from the list or filter.

## Step 2: Add available slots

1. Click **Add Slot** (or use drag-and-drop on the calendar).
2. Set:
   - Date
   - Start / End time
   - Slot length or buffer (if available)
3. Save the slot.

## Step 3: Create recurring availability

1. Choose **Recurring** (if available).
2. Set days of week and time window.
3. Save the recurring rule.

## Step 4: Edit or remove slots

1. Click a slot on the calendar.
2. Update time or delete the slot.
3. Save changes.

## Tips

- Use Team Availability to control **client booking** windows.
- Use Shift Management to control **staff labor schedules**.
- If bookings are not appearing, confirm a slot exists for that employee.
