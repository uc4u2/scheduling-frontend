# Xero Integration

without manual spreadsheets.

## Where to find it
- Manager Dashboard -> Settings -> Xero

## Connect Xero
1) Open the **Xero** tab in Settings.
2) Click **Connect Xero** and finish the OAuth consent flow.
3) Confirm the status shows your organization and an active connection.

## Map accounts
1) In **Payroll account mapping**, match Schedulaa payroll buckets (wages, taxes, tips, net pay)
   to the correct Xero accounts.
2) Save each mapping row.
3) If you use departments or locations, map them to Xero tracking categories.

## Export payroll
1) Go to **Payroll**.
2) Review the payroll summary and click **Send to accounting**.
3) Choose **Xero** and confirm the export.

## Troubleshooting
- If export fails, return to Settings -> Xero and click **Refresh status**.
- Reconnect if tokens expired.
