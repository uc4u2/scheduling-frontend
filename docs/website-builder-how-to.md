# Website Builder How-To (Manager)

Use the Website Builder to edit pages and publish changes, including templates and domains.

## Where to click

Manager Portal → Website & Pages → Visual Site Builder

## Step 1: Open the builder

1. Go to Manager Portal → Website & Pages → Visual Site Builder.
2. Choose the page you want to edit from the left panel.

### Page list basics

- Pages include Home, Services, About, Reviews, and custom landing pages.
- Draft vs published status appears next to each page.
- You can duplicate or reorder pages from the list.

## Step 2: Edit content

1. Click a section to open the inspector.
2. Update text, images, and layout options.
3. Use the Theme Designer to adjust colors and fonts.

### Common section fields

- Heading / subheading
- Body copy
- Buttons (label + link)
- Images or gallery blocks
- Layout toggles (alignment, spacing)

## Step 3: Add sections or templates

1. Click **Add Section** in the left panel.
2. Choose a template (hero, gallery, FAQ, services).
3. Drag to reorder sections as needed.

### Templates

## Step 4: Preview and publish

1. Click **Preview** to see the live layout.
2. Click **Publish** to make changes live.

### Publishing rules

- Draft changes do not affect the live site until you publish.
- Preview shows the draft state.

## Step 5: Connect a domain (optional)

1. Manager Portal → Website & Pages → Domain Settings.
2. Follow the DNS instructions and wait for SSL to activate.

### Domain fields you will see

- SSL status (Pending / Active)

## Tips

- Use **Inline Site Editor** for quick text fixes without opening the full builder.
