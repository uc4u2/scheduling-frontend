# Schedulaa vs QuickBooks Payroll

## Real Pricing and Operations Comparison for 20-Employee Teams

QuickBooks Payroll vs Schedulaa is one of the most common decisions we see from growing service businesses.

This guide covers:

- The real monthly cost of QuickBooks Payroll for a 20-employee team.
- What Schedulaa includes at the same headcount.
- Operational gaps that cause payroll errors.
- When Schedulaa is a better QuickBooks Payroll alternative.

## 1. QuickBooks Payroll Pricing (Real Cost for 20 Employees)

QuickBooks sells payroll only. Pricing is a base fee plus a per-employee fee, and discounts usually apply for just the first six months.

| Plan   | Base (promo → standard) | Per employee | 20 employees | Total (promo → standard) |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Core   | $25 → $50               | $4           | $80          | $86.25\* → $105          |
| Premium| $55 → $80               | $8           | $160         | $173.75\* → $215         |
| Elite  | $80 → $125              | $15          | $300         | $320\* → $380            |

\*Promo pricing usually lasts six months.

After the promotion ends, a 20-employee company pays **$105, $215, or $380 per month** for payroll only. There is no scheduling, break enforcement, PTO accrual logic, multi-step approvals, or unified audit trail. Anything operational requires additional tools.

## 2. Schedulaa Pricing (What’s Included)

Schedulaa is an Operations OS. Payroll is only one piece of the platform. Every plan bundles:

- Staff scheduling & shift templates.
- Smart break management (paid/unpaid, staggered breaks).
- Clock in/out & time tracking.
- PTO policies and automatic accruals.
- Leave requests & approvals.
- Compliance & audit logs.
- Payroll calculations and exports.
- Branded booking pages, websites, and checkout.

| Plan     | Staff included | Locations | Payroll included | Price     |
| -------- | -------------- | --------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| Starter  | 1              | 1         | No               | $19.99/mo |
| Pro      | Up to 5        | 1         | Yes (with payslip portal) | $49.99/mo |
| Business | Up to 10       | 2         | Yes (full payroll + W‑2/T4/ROE) | $119.99/mo |

Add-ons:

- Additional staff beyond plan quota: $9 per employee per month.
- Additional locations: $10 per location per month.

## 3. Schedulaa for 20 Employees (Real Scenario)

For a 20-employee service business:

- Business plan (includes 10 staff) → $119.99/mo.
- 10 additional staff × $9 → $90/mo.

**Total Schedulaa price for 20 employees: $219.99/mo.**

That $219.99/mo includes scheduling, break rules, time tracking, overtime logic, PTO, leave approvals, multi-location compliance, payroll exports, W‑2/T4/ROE, and QuickBooks/Xero exports—plus your booking pages and checkout.

## 4. True Cost Comparison (20 Employees)

| Stack                        | Monthly cost | Notes |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | ----- |
| QuickBooks Payroll Premium  | $215         | Payroll only |
| Scheduling add-on           | $40–$80      | Third-party app |
| Time tracking add-on        | $30–$60      | Third-party app |
| PTO/leave tracking          | $10–$30      | Manual or paid tool |
| **QuickBooks stack total**  | **$300–$450**| Operations handled by separate apps |
| **Schedulaa Business**      | **$219.99**  | All-in-one scheduling + payroll + websites |

QuickBooks Payroll is the final step once your data is perfect. Schedulaa fixes the operations that feed payroll—so schedules, breaks, PTO, and compliance are correct before pay run day.

## 5. Feature & Workflow Difference

**QuickBooks Payroll**
