# Public Site and Booking URLs

Every company has a public site based on its slug.

## Where to find the slug

Manager Portal → Website & Pages → Website Manager → Public URL

## Common public URLs

- Public site: `https://www.schedulaa.com/{slug}`
- Services: `https://www.schedulaa.com/{slug}/services`
- Products: `https://www.schedulaa.com/{slug}/products`
- Reviews: `https://www.schedulaa.com/{slug}/reviews`
- Booking: `https://www.schedulaa.com/{slug}/book`
- Basket / Checkout: `https://www.schedulaa.com/{slug}/basket`

If a user asks “Where do clients book?” send them to the Booking URL.
