Schedulaa vs QuickBooks Payroll

Real Pricing and Operations Comparison for 20-Employee Teams

QuickBooks Payroll vs Schedulaa is one of the most common questions we hear from service businesses with 10–50 employees.

This guide walks through:
- the real monthly cost of QuickBooks Payroll for a 20-employee team
- what Schedulaa includes at the same headcount
- the operational gaps that cause most payroll errors
- when Schedulaa is a better QuickBooks Payroll alternative for service teams

1. QuickBooks Payroll Pricing (Real Cost for 20 Employees)

QuickBooks sells payroll only. Pricing is a base fee plus per-employee fee, and discounts typically apply for the first six months only.

QuickBooks Online Payroll Plans
Core
- Base: $25/mo promo (then $50/mo)
- Per employee: $4/mo
- 20 employees: 20 × $4 = $80/mo
- Total: $25 + $80 = $105/mo (promo months ~$86.25)

Premium
- Base: $55/mo promo (then $80/mo)
- Per employee: $8/mo
- 20 employees: 20 × $8 = $160/mo
- Total: $55 + $160 = $215/mo (promo months ~$173.75)

Elite
- Base: $80/mo promo (then $125/mo)
- Per employee: $15/mo
- 20 employees: 20 × $15 = $300/mo
- Total: $80 + $300 = $380/mo (promo months ~$320)

After the promotion ends, a 20-employee company pays $105, $215, or $380 per month for payroll only. There is no scheduling, no break enforcement, no PTO accrual logic, no multi-step approvals, and no unified audit trail across shifts. All of that must be handled manually or with additional third-party tools.

3. Schedulaa for a 20-Employee Company (Real Scenario)

Business plan (includes 10 staff) → $119.99/mo
10 additional staff × $9 → $90/mo
Total: $119.99 + $90 = $219.99/mo

That $219.99/month includes scheduling, break enforcement, time tracking, overtime rules, PTO logic, leave approvals, multi-location compliance, payroll engine for US & Canada, W-2/T4/ROE file generation, Xero and QuickBooks exports, and branded booking + checkout.

Schedulaa replaces separate scheduling apps, separate time tracking, manual break tracking, PTO spreadsheets, and stand-alone payroll calculators.

4. True Cost Comparison (20 Employees)

QuickBooks Payroll Premium → $215/mo for payroll only. Realistic stack once you add scheduling ($40–$80), time tracking ($30–$60), and PTO tools often lands between $300–$450/mo.

Schedulaa Business → $219.99/mo all-in for scheduling, break management, time tracking, PTO, payroll, compliance exports, websites, checkout, and accounting exports.

5. Feature & Workflow Difference
QuickBooks Payroll focuses on running payroll once data is already clean. No native scheduling, break enforcement, clock-ins, PTO accruals, shift swaps, or multi-location workflows.

Schedulaa fixes operations before payroll, tying booking, scheduling, breaks, and time tracking together. Every shift, break, PTO request, and timesheet flows into payroll automatically, generating W-2, T4, ROE, and summarizing payroll data for QuickBooks or Xero.

6. Who Should Use Schedulaa Instead of QuickBooks Payroll Alone?
Schedulaa is a better fit if you run a service team with 3–50 employees, need scheduling + payroll in one system, are tired of manual PTO and fragmented apps, want clean audit trails, need US + Canada payroll, or still want your accountant to use QuickBooks/Xero without day-to-day chaos.

7. Summary: Schedulaa vs QuickBooks Payroll
- QuickBooks pricing punishes growth with per-employee fees and extra tools.
- Schedulaa pricing is predictable: base tier + $9 per extra staff.
- QuickBooks solves payroll. Schedulaa solves operations.
- QuickBooks bolts into your workflow. Schedulaa is the workflow.
- QuickBooks requires accountants to reconcile multiple tools. Schedulaa captures everything in one system.

For growing service businesses, Schedulaa is both a complete QuickBooks Payroll alternative and a cleaner way to feed accurate data back into QuickBooks or Xero.
